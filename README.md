### Prerequistites 

### Future Plans

Not enough data to be confident in the performance of the model during term time (as most of the data is from the end of exams and holidays), so we to wait till the 2024/25 academic year begins to collect more. Also, having more data will enable the occpurtunity to other mdoels such as LTSM or Facebook Prophet, which are require more data than currently available.
